# Decentralized-E-Voting-System-Using-Blockchain
B.Tech Project

Voting is a fundamental right for every nation. An Electronic Voting (E-Voting) system is
a voting system in which the election process is notated, saved, stored, and processed
digitally, which makes the voting management task better than the traditional paper-based
method. Blockchain is offering new opportunities to develop new types of digital services.
Because of the properties such as transparency, decentralization, irreversibility,
nonrepudiation, etc., blockchain is not only a fundamental technology of great interest in its
own right but also has large potential when integrated into many other areas. In this project,
the concept of developing an electronic voting system using blockchain technology is
implemented. The two-level architecture provides a secure voting process without the
redundancy of existing (not based on blockchain) systems. The blockchain-based voting
project has two modules to make the whole project integrated and work along. One will be
the Election Commission who will be responsible for creating elections, adding registered
parties, and candidates contesting for the election added under the smart contracts. The other
end will be the voter's module where each individual can cast a vote for their respective
Assembly Constituency and the vote will be registered on the blockchain to make it
tamper-proof. In previous research because of the transparency property from blockchain,
ballots are visible when they are cast to the blockchain network. This exposes the progress of
the election during the voting phase, and may greatly influence the outcome of the election.
Here, we come up with a solution by simply employing a permissioned blockchain for the
election. The attention-seeking idea is to use two linked side chains, a one-way pegged
sidechain. The first sidechain records the voting operation of voters and the second sidechain
counts the votes assigned to the various candidates
